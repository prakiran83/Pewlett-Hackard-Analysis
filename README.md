# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this project is to determine a) the number of retiring employees per title, and b) to identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.
In order to achieve these results, we are tasked with creating two tables that contains details of employees that are retiring and 
those who are ready to take over the vacancy, which will be create by the mass retirement.


## Results
Table 1: Number of retiring employees with title.

Table 2: Employees that are eligible for mentorship.

The 4 takeaways that I can gather after reviewing above tables are:
1. The people in senior positions, engineer & staff, make a big chunk of employees that are about to retire.
2. Senior engineer and staff positions should be considered as a top most priority for hiring or mentoring for.
3. There are 1549 employees who are eligible for a mentorship program.
4. There are more people retiring than there are people who are eligible for a mentorship program.

## Summary
1. How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?


Currently, we are looking 90,398 roles that can be vaccated at any moment. In order to negate the impact of "silver tsunami," we have to strategies on how to hire externally.

2) Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?


Like I mentioned above, we need to strategize for external hiring because there are not enough people to mentor internally. There are 1549 possible candidates in contrast to 90,398 roles that can be vacated.


Two additional queries:
1. Create a query with a list of people who are retiring at the end of the current year and also for each following years. 
2. Create a query that groups employees who are mentor-eligible with position titles so that we can determine how many employees can be mentored by a particular mentor.
